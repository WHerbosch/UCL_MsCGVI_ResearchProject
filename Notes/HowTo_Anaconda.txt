Anaconda is a districution of the Python and R programming languages.
It is used for large-scale data processing, predictive analysis and scientific computing.
It aims to simplify package management and deployment. 

When wanting to work on multiple projects, these projects may only working using certain packaged that can only be found in certain versions of Python. 
So instead of formulating the projects to work under the same set of packages, we can create different python environments that have specific packages that we need. 

This is an amazing tool in situations where you need to swap between Python 2 and 3

> conda list
Lists all the python packages that comes preinstalled with Anaconda 

> conda create --name NAME PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ... PACKAGEN
Creates a new Python environment 
where NAME is the name of the environment 
PACKAGE1,2,N are the specific package names you want the environment to have
Note: You need at least one PACKAGE to create a new environment 

> source activate NAME
Enter the environment
Note: You can use "> pip list" to double-check the packages in that environment

> which python 
Check which environment you're currenrtly in

> source deactivate 
Close environment 

> conda create --name NAME python=VERNUM PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2 ... PACKAGEN
Creates a new Python environment with a specific Python version
where VERNUM is the version number of Python that is to be used (i.e. 2.7)

> conda env list
Lists the environments that have been created 
Note: an * should appear next to the environment that you are currently in

> conda remove --name NAME PACKAGE
