The general structure of the directory goes as such:

Data: 
- Contains any useful images or mat files, primarily those from the NYU dataset.

Documents:
- Contains main pdf documents to be assessed throughout the project, including the final report. 

Models:
- Contains any models produced throughout the training/testing process.

Notes:
- Contains simple txt files that act as guides for understanding how to work with GitHub in Terminal as well as general notes taken for understanding the third party tools listed in the implementation section.

Programs: 
- Contains all programs developed for the Project.

Reading:
- Contains digital pdfs of all the core reading material for this project.

Presentation_(ResearchMethods):
- Contains a spare copy of the PowerPoint presentation made for the Research Methods module. Keep in mind this was an initial design for the project, which drastically differs from the final product.
